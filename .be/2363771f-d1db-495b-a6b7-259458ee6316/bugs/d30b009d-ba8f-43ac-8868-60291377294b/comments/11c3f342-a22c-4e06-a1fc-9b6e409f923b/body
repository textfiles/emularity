This turned out to be a problem related to the mess->mame rename.

messexidy.js became mameexidy.js, but the example wasn't changed and
the messexidy.js file was left in place on the IA servers, so there
were no glarinly obvious signs that something had gone wrong, like a
404. Fixed the example a few revisions back.
